EIFLP - An Eiffel library for linear programming.
--------
Version 0.1
--------
- Export almost all the c api of lp_solve library.
- MODEL and SOLUTION class is used for the ease of cache.
- For time measure, time_enlapsed function can be called.
- APLICATION class contains some simple tests.
- Project setting is set to void safety.

- Bonus: An simplex algorithm implemented from scratch in Eiffel.

- Kindly note, to run the Autotest (you don't have to do that), you should change the path of the testcase, since I did not know how to set a relative path correctly. If you know how to set the relative path, please tell me.
